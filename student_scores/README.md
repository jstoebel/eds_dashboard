Store raw student score files here in `student_scores/raw`. When you run `rake student_scores`,
they will be converted and placed in `student_scores/formatted`

## How to organize files

Place your raw files in `raw` separated by the input type they originated from. Currently the accepted formats are:

 - moodle
 - qualtrics

You'll find your resulting files in `formatted`
